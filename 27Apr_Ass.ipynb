Epsilon is the radius of the circle to be created around each data point to check the density and minPoints is the minimum number of data points required inside that circle for that data point to be classified as a Core point."

    "Sol : Optimal number of Clusters in K-Means Clustering can be determined by elbow curve.In the Elbow method, we are actually varying the number of clusters (K) according to us. For each value of K, we are calculating WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Square). WCSS is the sum of the squared distance between each point and the centroid in a cluster. When we plot the WCSS with the K value, the plot looks like an Elbow.When we analyze the graph, we can see that the graph will rapidly change at a point and thus creating an elbow shape. From this point, the graph moves almost parallel to the X-axis. The K value corresponding to this point is the optimal value of K or an optimal number of clusters."

This makes it important to identify and handle outliers before applying k-means clustering to ensure that the results are meaningful and not skewed by the presence of outliers. There are various methods to identify and handle outliers, such as removing them, transforming them, or using a robust variant of k-means clustering that is less sensitive to the presence of outliers.\n",
